# Installation

## Requirements

| Component | Minimum | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Magento | 2.4.4 | 2.4.7 / 2.4.8 recommended |
| PHP | 8.1 | 8.2 / 8.3 / 8.4 / 8.5 supported |
| MySQL | 8.0 | MariaDB 10.6+ also works |
| Outbound HTTPS | port 443 | To `ledger.byte8.io` only — no direct connection to Xero |
| Composer | 2.x | 2.7+ recommended |

The connector is a **SaaS subscription**. You'll also need:

- A Byte8 account at [byte8.io](https://byte8.io) — free 14-day trial, no card required.
- A Xero account that you control (you OAuth your own Xero company into the chassis after pairing the Magento side).

The connector itself doesn't store any credentials in PHP — Xero OAuth tokens live encrypted in our hosted ledger. The only secret stored on your Magento side is the per-tenant `api_key` (encrypted via Magento's `EncryptorInterface` in `core_config_data`), and even that is set automatically by the pairing handshake.

## Install

```bash
composer require byte8/magento-xero-accounting
bin/magento module:enable Byte8_Core Byte8_Client Byte8_XeroAccounting
bin/magento setup:upgrade
bin/magento setup:di:compile         # production mode only
bin/magento cache:flush
```

`composer require byte8/magento-xero-accounting` transitively pulls:

- `byte8/module-client` — shared chassis (outbox, JWT auth, canonical REST endpoints, sync-state mirror table)
- `byte8/module-core` — Magento utilities the chassis depends on

Three Magento modules end up enabled: `Byte8_Core`, `Byte8_Client`, `Byte8_XeroAccounting`. Verify with:

```bash
bin/magento module:status | grep Byte8
```

## Cargoman (closed beta only)

While the connector is in closed beta, packages live on **Cargoman** (Byte8's private Composer registry) rather than Packagist. Add the registry to your project's `composer.json` before the `composer require`:

```bash
composer config repositories.byte8 composer https://cargoman.byte8.io/<your-key>/
composer require byte8/magento-xero-accounting
```

The registry URL is in the welcome email Byte8 sends after you sign up for the trial. After public launch, the package will be available on Packagist directly without registry config.

## Coexistence with Sage Accounting and FreeAgent

If you already run `byte8/magento-sage-accounting` or `byte8/magento-freeagent-accounting` on this install, **all connectors coexist on the same Magento** — they share the `byte8/module-client` chassis. The outbox carries a `provider` column and routes events per provider; grid join aliases are suffixed per provider (`byte8_sync_status_xero` / `byte8_sync_status_freeagent` / etc.) so each provider's Status chip sits in its own column on Sales → Invoices.

You'll pair each connector independently — see [Pairing-code Connect flow](/docs/connect/pairing-code).

## Post-install verification

```bash
bin/magento module:status Byte8_XeroAccounting
# → Module is enabled

bin/magento config:show byte8/xero_accounting/tenant_id
# → empty (you haven't paired yet — fine)

bin/magento dev:tests:run unit -- Byte8/XeroAccounting   # optional sanity check
```

In the admin: **Stores → Configuration → Byte8 → Xero Accounting** should render a config page with a red "Not connected" status block + a **Generate pairing code** button. That's the install verification.

## Database changes

`bin/magento setup:upgrade` creates two tables (both owned by `byte8/module-client`):

- `byte8_event_outbox` — transport queue for outbound events. Drained by the `byte8_outbox_drain` cron every minute. Carries a `provider` column so events route correctly across coexisting connectors.
- `byte8_entity_sync_state` — Magento-side mirror of ledger sync outcomes. Drives the Xero Status chips on the admin grids and detail pages.

The connector itself adds Magento config rows under `byte8/xero_accounting/*` for the pairing flow but no new tables.

## Cron

One cron is registered (in `byte8/module-client`):

```xml
<job name="byte8_outbox_drain" instance="Byte8\Client\Cron\OutboxDrain" method="execute">
    <schedule>* * * * *</schedule>
</job>
```

A daily cleanup job (`byte8_outbox_gc`) GCs `succeeded` outbox rows older than 30 days. No per-provider crons — one drain job handles every provider's events.

If your Magento install doesn't have cron running (`bin/magento cron:run` from system cron, or the `magento_cron` job in production), the outbox will fill up and never drain. Verify cron is healthy with:

```bash
bin/magento cron:run --group=default
```

## Uninstall

```bash
bin/magento module:disable Byte8_XeroAccounting
composer remove byte8/magento-xero-accounting
bin/magento setup:upgrade
```

This stops the Xero observers from firing and removes the module from the autoload. The `byte8_event_outbox` and `byte8_entity_sync_state` tables stay (audit data) and the shared `Byte8_Client` / `Byte8_Core` chassis stays enabled if other Byte8 connectors (Sage / FreeAgent) are still installed; drop them manually if you want a clean slate. Disconnect on the ledger side from **Stores → Configuration → Byte8 → Xero Accounting → Disconnect** *before* removing the module so the chassis flips its binding row to `revoked`.

## Network requirements

- **Outbound from Magento:** HTTPS to `ledger.byte8.io` (port 443) only. No direct connection to `api.xero.com` from Magento.
- **Inbound to Magento:** the chassis posts to your Magento's `/rest/V1/byte8/*` endpoints (canonical entity getters, sync-state callback). These need to be reachable from `ledger.byte8.io` over HTTPS — same surface every Magento install already exposes for its REST API.

If your Magento is behind a WAF / IP allowlist, allow the byte8.io egress IP range (in your welcome email).
